<body>
    <h1>100 door Problem</h1>
    <p>There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
<br>
You make 100 passes by the doors. <br>
The first time through, visit every door and toggle the door (if the door is closed, open it; if it is open, close it).
<br>
The second time, only visit every 2nd door (door #2, #4, #6, ...), and toggle it.
<br>
The third time, visit every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc, until you only visit the 100th door.
<br><br>
Task <br>
Answer the question: what state are the doors in after the last pass? Which are open, which are closed?</p>
